# S3 Storage Provider

AWS S3 storage backend for persisting Ethereum network discovery results as JSON.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Implements flexible S3 configuration supporting both AWS and S3-compatible endpoints
- Uses AWS SDK v2 with custom endpoint resolution for compatibility

## Important Constraints
- Always initialize client lazily on first upload to support dynamic configuration
- Handle AWS SDK errors with proper context wrapping
- Support both standard AWS S3 and alternative S3-compatible services (MinIO, etc.)
