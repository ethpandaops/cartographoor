# Discovery Component

Network and client discovery orchestration service that coordinates multiple providers to scan GitHub repositories and aggregate Ethereum network information.

## Key Architecture Pattern
- Uses provider pattern for extensible discovery sources via `discovery.Provider` interface
- Concurrent provider execution with result aggregation
- Thread-safe provider and handler registration with mutex protection

## Critical Design Decisions
- Providers must be stateless and return complete network maps
- GitHub token required in config to prevent API rate limiting
- Result handlers called synchronously - keep processing lightweight
