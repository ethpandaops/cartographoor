Environment variable substitution utilities for configuration parsing.

## Primary Purpose
Provides safe environment variable substitution in strings and byte arrays supporting both ${VAR} and $VAR syntax.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Stateless utility functions for use throughout the codebase
- Returns original text when environment variables are not found (safe defaults)
- Supports configuration file parsing with env var interpolation

## Important Constraints
- Must preserve original text when environment variables don't exist
- Regular expression based parsing for performance
