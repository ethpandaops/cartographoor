# GitHub Mock

Test utility that simulates GitHub API responses using containerized nginx server.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Uses testcontainers-go to spin up nginx container serving static JSON responses
- Simulates GitHub repository structure with mock network configurations

## Important Constraints
- Only for testing - never use in production code
- Container lifecycle must be properly managed with Close() to avoid resource leaks
