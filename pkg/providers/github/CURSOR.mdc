# GitHub Provider

Discovers Ethereum network configurations from GitHub repositories by scanning network-configs directories.

## Key Integration Pattern
- Uses GitHub API v53 client with OAuth2 authentication
- Parses YAML configurations to extract network metadata and service URLs
- Maps repository directory structure to network discovery results

## Important Constraints
- Requires GitHub token to avoid rate limiting
- Only processes networks with kubernetes deployment configurations
- Network status determined by presence in kubernetes or kubernetes-archive directories
