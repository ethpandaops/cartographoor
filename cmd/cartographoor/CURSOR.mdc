# Cartographoor CLI Component

Command-line interface that bootstraps and runs the cartographoor network discovery service.

## Key Patterns

- **Cobra Command Structure**: All commands use cobra with structured subcommands pattern
- **Viper Configuration**: Config loading with environment variable substitution using `utils.EnvSubstBytes`
- **Context Propagation**: Commands must respect context cancellation for graceful shutdown

## Important Constraints

- **Run-Once Mode**: Support both continuous and one-time discovery modes via `--once` flag
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM with 5-second timeout
