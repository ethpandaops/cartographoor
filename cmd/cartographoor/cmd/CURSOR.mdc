# Cartographoor CMD Component

Cobra command definitions that implement the cartographoor CLI functionality.

## Key Integration Pattern

- **Provider Registration**: Commands must register all discovery providers (GitHub, Static) before starting the service
- **Service Lifecycle**: Commands orchestrate discovery service creation, provider registration, and result handling

## Important Constraints

- **Error Context**: All errors must be wrapped with descriptive context using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`
- **Config Processing**: Environment variable substitution must occur before viper unmarshalling
